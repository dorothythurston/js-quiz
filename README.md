# Quiz App
Quiz app with multiple sets of Disney trivia questions. App features ability for user to choose set, randomly selects choices, keeps user's score and gives user results, indicates to the user how far along in the quiz the user is, as well as multiple fun css stylings per set choice.

Things I worked on while making this app:
- Refactoring JS
- Using JS prototypes and object oriented code
- JS best practices and functionality like ternaries
- Creating shapes with CSS
